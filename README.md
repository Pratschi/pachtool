# Pachtool
A Shell-Like python tool with a lot of potential because of the ability to add Extensions.
## How to use it?
Just download the latest **pachtool** version from the `Releases` folder.
## Adding extensions
<br>Then download all **extensions** you want or need from the `Extensions` folder, and add them to the same folder as the pachtool file.
<br>Execute the **pachtool** file and then run `ext install <file>` to add the extension.
<br>Finally, run `data save`, wich will generate a file called `shelltool_data.json` wich saves all your data.
<br>**NOTE: IT MUST BE ON THE SAME FOLDER AS THE PACHTOOL FILE**
