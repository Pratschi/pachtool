# Pachtool
A Shell-Like python tool with a lot of potential because of the ability to add Extensions.
## How to use it?
Just download the latest **pachtool** version from the `Releases` folder.
## Adding extensions
Download all the **extensions** you want from the `Extensions` folder, and put them to the same folder as the pachtool file.
<br>Execute the **pachtool** file and then run `ext install <file>` to add the extension.
<br>Now, the extension file is no longer required and can be deleted as long as the program is running or data is saved.
